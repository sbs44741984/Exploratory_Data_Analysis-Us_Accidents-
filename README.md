# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Us_Accidents-
The primary objective of this project is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about road accidents in the United States. Through EDA, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can inform stakeholders about the characteristics and factors contributing to road accidents.

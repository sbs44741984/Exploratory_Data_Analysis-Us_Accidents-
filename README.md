# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Us_Accidents-

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on US Accidents
Project Description
Objective:
The goal of this project is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of road accidents in the United States. The aim is to identify patterns, trends, and insights that can help understand the factors contributing to accidents and provide useful information for prevention measures.

Dataset:

Source: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and datasets.
Contents: The dataset includes various attributes related to road accidents such as:
Location: Latitude and longitude of the accident site.
Time and Date: When the accident occurred.
Weather Conditions: Weather at the time of the accident.
Road Conditions: Road surface and visibility conditions.
Temperature: Ambient temperature at the time of the accident.
Utility: This information can be instrumental in identifying accident-prone areas, understanding the impact of weather and road conditions on accidents, and formulating strategies to enhance road safety.
Exclusion: Notably, the dataset does not contain data for New York City, which is important to consider when interpreting results and patterns.
Data Preparation and Cleaning:

Loading the Data: The dataset will be loaded using Pandas for manipulation and analysis.
Initial Inspection: An initial inspection will be conducted to understand the structure of the data, the information it contains, and the columns present.
Data Cleaning: This step will involve fixing any missing or incorrect values to ensure data quality and reliability.
Exploratory Analysis and Visualization:
We will focus on the following columns for analysis:

City: To understand the geographic distribution of accidents.
Start Time: To analyze temporal patterns in accident occurrences.
Start Lat, Start Lng: For geospatial analysis and mapping of accidents.
Temperature: To examine the effect of temperature on accident frequency.
Weather Condition: To study the impact of different weather conditions on accidents.
Questions to Explore:

Are there more accidents in warmer or colder areas?
Which five states have the highest number of accidents? How does this look per capita?
Does New York appear in the data? If yes, why is the count lower despite being the most populated city?
Among the top 100 cities in terms of accident numbers, which states do they belong to most frequently?
At what time of day are accidents most frequent?
Which days of the week see the most accidents?
Which months experience the highest number of accidents?
What is the year-over-year trend in accident numbers (increasing or decreasing)?
When are accidents per unit of traffic the highest?
Summary and Conclusion:
The analysis will culminate in a summary of findings and conclusions, highlighting key insights and potential recommendations for accident prevention.

Tools and Technologies:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Manipulation: NumPy, Pandas
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Mapping: Folium (for geospatial analysis)
This EDA project on US accidents aims to provide actionable insights that can contribute to enhancing road safety and reducing the number of accidents.
